## Installation
Copy a rom of `Sonic 3 & Knuckles` to ports/sonic3air and rename it to `Sonic_Knuckles_wSonic3.bin`.

## Default Controls
Sonic 3 AIR runs entirely on SDL controls and plays like any other Sonic game.

## Mods
Mod folders can be pasted into `sonic3air/config/mods` and then toggled on or off at the title screen.
